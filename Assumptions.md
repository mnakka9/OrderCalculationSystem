## Assumptions

1. **Tax Rates and Rules**: Tax rates and rules are currently hardcoded within the application code. For better maintainability and flexibility, these should ideally be moved to a configuration file or a database.
2. **State Codes**: Similar to tax rates, state codes are also hardcoded in the application. It is recommended to store these codes in a database to facilitate easier updates and management.
3. **Discount Strategy**: The implementation uses a strategy pattern to apply various discounts, with hardcoded tax rates. There is potential to enhance this logic for greater flexibility and adaptability.
4. **Product Classification**: The classification of luxury items is handled within the `Product` entity. This approach should be reviewed to ensure it meets business requirements effectively.
5. **Coupons and Promotions**: The system allows for the combination of coupons and promotions when applying discounts to an order. This logic should be thoroughly tested to ensure accuracy and fairness.
